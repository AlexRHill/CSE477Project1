    <p>There is an area for five pipes that are available to the player. The playing area above has an invisible grid of one of three sizes selected in the opening screen.</p>

    <p>A player always has five available pipes. Each turn they can select one of the pipes using the radio button next to it. Then they can rotate it as many times as they like, then click on an open space that extends their pipe. They can only add a pipe where it will connect to their pipes. No other locations will work.</p>

    <p>If they press discard, the selected pipe section is discarded and the turn ends.</p>

    <p>Give up indicates that a player gives up.</p>

    <p>If player has a completely connected pipe, they press Open Valve to turn on the steam. If there is a leak in their pipe, they lose. If they have successfully connected the source to the destination, they win.</p>
